The park contains the largest remaining natural stand of coast redwood found in the East Bay. Redwood forests are more commonly found closer to the coast where the air is cool and humid year-round. In the Bay Area, such forests are found in the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Marin Hills. The unique geographical circumstances of the redwood forest in Redwood Regional Park create coastal conditions. Winds funneled through the Golden Gate flow directly across the Bay and are channeled into the linear valley in which the Montclair District of Oakland is situated. This valley is also well-watered all year round and is protected from extremes of temperature and high winds."

It remained in the family until the early 1930s. In 1940 it was given to Contra Costa County and afterward was given to the Horsemens Association which set out to reconstruct the adobe.

These primary cities together with adjoining unincorporated communities and several small towns comprise a Humboldt Bay Area total population of nearly 80,000 people, which accounts for nearly 60% of the population of Humboldt County. In addition to being home to more than 100 plant species, 300 invertebrate species, 100 fish species, and 200 bird species, the bay and its complex system of marshes and grasses support hundreds of thousands of migrating and local shore birds.

The territory was incorporated into Roop County, Nevada, named for Isaac Roop, in 1861. California and Nevada entered into a border dispute known as the Roop County War over the Susanville area in 1863, and Roop's Fort served as a fort for the Nevadans during the skirmish.

Built in the early 1850s, the adobe is typical of the building style prevalent during and around California's period of Mexican governance. Raimundo Yorba built the adobe on land thought to be part of Rancho El Rincon, a land grant owned by his father, Bernardo Yorba; however, a later survey determined the adobe was not part of the rancho. The younger Yorba lived in the adobe until 1868, when Forty-Niner and Mexican-American War veteran Fenton M. Slaughter bought the house. Slaughter, who later served in the California State Assembly, lived in the house until his 1897 death."

The area was mined for silver during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Remnants of mining operations such as the Blue Light Mine are still scattered in the area. Timber was harvested for use by the railroad. Coal was mined at the time in Carbondale. Ancient sea life fossils can be found within the sandstone cliffs in the area. During Spanish rule, the canyon was visited by Spanish explorers and was known by the name Cañada de la Madera (Timber Canyon). The town in Spain by that name bears a remarkable resemblance to Silverado. (The name Silverado is a type of Spanglish indicating a place where silver is found; a parallel formation to El Dorado.) The area enjoyed a renaissance in popularity in the 1940s as a hot springs vacation retreat, during which time hotels and restaurants prospered. A large number of weekend cabins were also built at that time. Home to a number of artists and craftsmen, the town now consists of about 2000 residents, a general store, a cafe, a public library, a church, two fire stations, a community center, and a post office. It hosts summer concerts, an annual Country Fair, and an Easter breakfast. A local landmark near Silverado is Cook's Corner, popular with motorcyclists."

The party reached San Pedro Creek on October 31 and camped there for four nights, while scouts led by José Francisco Ortega climbed Sweeney Ridge, where they could see over the ridge toward the east, and so became the first Europeans to see San Francisco Bay on November 1."

He named it Lachryma Montis (mountain tear) a rough Latin translation of Chiucuyem (crying mountain) - the Native American name for the free-flowing spring on the property. The estate was located at the foot of the hills half-a-mile west and north of Sonoma's central plaza. In 1849, after returning from Monterey and California's 1849 Constitutional Convention, Vallejo determined to move his growing family from La Casa Grande and the center of Sonoma. He remembered the location of the spring from an early trip surveying areas around Mission San Francisco Solano. The design of the house and its furnishings illustrate Vallejo's ongoing Americanization and his openness to new ideas. When the family moved to the estate near the end of 1852 the accumulated cost of the estate exceeded $150,000."
